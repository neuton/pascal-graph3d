pascal-graph3d
==============
Simple software 3D graphics engine + Rubik's Cube on Pascal made some years ago for fun.
It is actually unfinished and probably won't be finished (at least in the nearest future).
The binaries included are built for Windows with TMT Pascal Lite compiler.
You probably need a DOSBox to run those binaries.
